## Exercise 5.1
>What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?

The null statement may be used as a placeholder when a statement is expected. For example:
```cpp
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    ; // null statement.
```
